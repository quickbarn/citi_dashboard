## Phenomenons in the Citi Bike Data

### 2017-September 2020

1. Riders in their 50's don't care to identify their gender, they just want to ride
2. Rides that occur in Q1 are the lowest and tend to be round trips, from actual stations
3. The predominant use of bikes tend to be "commute to work" related based on the time of day that they occur
   1. across all age groups and quarters
4. The age groups with the most use are those in the late 20's to mid 30's and early 50's.
5. Rides tend to be cyclical year round (which would be expected)
   1. This shows true even during a pandemic year, ride numbers in FY2020 Q3 rebounded drastically from a poor showing in Q2
